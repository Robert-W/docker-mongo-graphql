Docker, Mongo, and GraphQL (WIP)
================================
> A quick start setup for a docker based developer environment for an application using MongoDB, Mongoose, and GraphQL.

### Getting Started
1. Make sure you have the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) installed.
2. Copy `env/local.env.example` to `env/local.env` and fill in the appropiate fields. (This will come into play as this boilerplate grows)
3. From root, run `docker-compose up`.
4. Visit `localhost:3000` and enjoy.

### Things still working on
1. Everything
2. Live-reload with nodemon and browser files
3. Testing framework
